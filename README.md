# Planning-using-PDDL

This repository contains a project focused on defining and solving planning problems using PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language). The project includes implementations for classic AI planning scenarios such as the blocksworld, 4x4 puzzle, robot docker, and optionally, the Wumpus adventure game.

Features

	•	Definition of planning domains and problems using PDDL.
	•	Implementation of solutions for blocksworld, 4x4 puzzle, and robot docker scenarios.
	•	Comparison of different planning methods and their performance.
	•	Optional bonus task: Solving the Wumpus adventure game.

 How It Works

	1.	Blocksworld Problem:
	•	Solve three blocksworld problems using various planners.
	•	Compare performance metrics such as execution time and efficiency.
	2.	4x4 Puzzle:
	•	Define domain and problem files to solve a 4x4 puzzle.
	3.	Robot Docker Problem:
	•	Define a domain to stack containers in specific configurations.
	4.	Optional Wumpus Adventure Game:
	•	Create domain and problem files for navigating the Wumpus environment, retrieving gold, and avoiding the Wumpus.

Results

	•	Efficient solutions for all planning problems with detailed comparisons of planning methods.
	•	Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various planners.
